#+TITLE: TypedFlow: A library for higher-order typed deep learning
#+AUTHOR: Jean-Philippe Bernardy, University of Gothenburg

TensorFlow is a library for numerical computation, with specific
features for machine-learning such as gradient computation. It is
perhaps the most popular backend for deep learning applications.
TypedFlow a higher-order and typed (HOT) frontend to TensorFlow
written in Haskell, and a library of neural-network layers and
combinators.


In this talk I will:

- briefly recall what TensorFlow is and how it applies to deep
  learning
- discuss the advantages of a HOT approach vs. plain TensorFlow
- expose two use-cases: the standard MNIST example and a
sequence-to-sequence network with attention model.


Ideas: transparency, explainability



* Machine learning in 45 seconds:

- a vector of training inputs X::[A]
- a model f : (Θ × A) → ℝ⁺

Task:

Given X, find θ such that f(θ,x) < ε, if
x is considered similar to points in X, and > ε otherwise.

Commentary: Every point in X lie on a manyfold. We want to find what
this manyfold is. (Interpolation problem.)

* "Deep" learning in 45 seconds

- "Deep" ≡ f is "complicated"
- So we must use a brute force method to compute θ: stochastic
  gradient descent (or variants thereof).

- Typically, compute the gradient of f wrt. θ using AD.

* Tensorflow

- A (meta) programming language to define f. AD is builtin. (there is
  fineprint)

- Restricted control flow (mostly, tensor-generalisations of +, *, -,
  /, ^, tanh, ...)

- Typically programmed using python (standard in scientific computing)

- "Strongly typed"
  - but: no abstraction over dimensions
  - but: "brodcasting"
  - but: running the metaprogram can be quite slow ~1 minute (so type
    errors can happen after 1 minute of loading the model --- and
    programs can do other things before ...)
  - but: types are typically not written as such. Given any two
    functions, weather they compose (and what the composition does) is
    a mistery unless one examines their code.

- "map" has a surprising semantics (see below)

* What is TypedFlow?

- An typed, higher-order frontend to tensorflow
  (basic tensor operations)
- A library to construct neural networks
- Generates python

* Why TypedFlow?

Functional programming is ideally suited to program complicated
applications from building blocks.

- Notation
- Types
- HO

(Actually this has become worse!)
* Notation

Haskell is typically much closer to mathematical notation than
python. Programs are short to write and easier to read.

file:../TypedFlow/TF.hs::/⊕.*::/

* Why Types?

Types can be used to check the tensor dimensions.

- Types catch a lof of errors
- but they can also be used to *guide* the programming. "Type holes"
  (see MNIST example)

Types are pretty much a necessity to take advantage of HO functions.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Together with the absence of side effects, rich type systems enable to
construct complex programs with a high degree of confidence:

- types precisely abstract the intention of the programmer for each function,
  without any hidden side effect, and
- provided that they match the contracts imposed by types, functions
  can be freely combined, using lazy evaluation and higher-order
  facilities, without risk of pernicious interference.

(search "class LSTM")

* Example 1: LSTM

file:../TypedFlow/Layers/RNN.hs::/^lstm.*::/

* Example 2: Attention

Example: an "Attention-model" is a model where every step in a RNN
adds a computation which depends on an external input. We can compose
usual RNN cells with attention models in several ways. The state of
the art is to reprogram such combinations by hand.

* Mapping tensors

- Tensorflow's ~map~ spawns processes. This is (usually) quite a bad
  idea --- tensor operations are parallelized anyway (but not on
  several GPUs... the purpose of ~map~ apparently).

- Most (but not all!) operations have so-called "broadcast semantics";
  they can be (implicitly!) raised to tensors of higher dimensions.

- file:../TypedFlow/Abstract.hs::/^protoBroadcast.*::/

  - Note "gather" goes to "gather_nd"
  - Certain convolutions can't be broadcasted at all 😿

* Pretending that tensor operations are functional

- They are EXCEPT that sharing is lost
- Use the old trick of observable sharing. (Memoizing, etc.)

* Long game

- Integrate cutting edge DL ideas as they arrive with moderate effort.
